# PyBer Analysis

### Overview

The purpose of this challenge was to showcase the chart-making abilities of Matplotlib in Pandas as a way to further review our ride-share information from PyBer and present to our client. I was asked to review and analyze ride-sharing data from January to April of 2019. The analysis includes a merged dataframe showing ride-sharing summaries by data type, a line chart of total fares by city type, and a written analysis.


### Results

A review of our data shows drastic differences between urban, suburban and rural ride-share information. While urban cities have higher numbers of rides, drivers and total fares, a rural city is likely to have higher fares for individual clients and also drivers, likely simply due to supply and demand.

Here is a line chart of the fare summary by city type. Suburan and urban areas earn quite a bit more in fares while rural falls sharply below. However, rural areas do seem to keep more steady fare prices moving into the spring where suburban and urban areas, where people are more likely to walk or bike, see a sharp drop come April.

### Summary

V. Isualize,

After reviewing PyBer's ride-sharing data and comparing the amounts of drivers and average fares in each city type, there is quite a bit of discrepency between the three. 

While your drivers in rural areas are earning slightly better fares, ride-sharing users are paying quite a bit more compared to urban and suburban riders. This correlates with the number of available drivers in rural areas. They are likely more occupied with riders thus less available, raising the costs of those looking for a ride. I have no doubt that this deters some people from using PyBer as a a ride-sharing option. I would consider either cutting fares or adding in a promotion for riders in rural areas to increase ridership. You could also consider an incentive and retention program to get more drivers on the road for PyBer.

Ridership in both urban and suburban areas dropped fairly sharply in April. This may be because the weather is warming up and more people are opting to walk or bike to their destination. Perhaps a promotion for riders in urban and suburban zones would bring up usage during this time period and into early summer.
